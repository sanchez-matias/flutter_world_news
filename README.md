# World News

Here you can consult for news articles from different sources of many parts of the world. All compiled by a single public API.

The articles are truncated to a fixed number of characters due to not being subscibed to the premium version of the API, so the content can be incomplete if you read the new into the app.

## Main Features

- HTTP requests for remote articles.
- SQL database for local articles (Save and Delete).
- Subcategorizing saved articles.
- Theme changing.
- Search.
- Web view of articles.
- Clean architecture and dependency injection.
